# SEIR 0508 - Unit 1 JavaScript Project - WIP

## Description

A text-based browser game in the style of Oregon Trail.

## Getting Started

You will receive prompts at the top of the screen. At the bottom of the screen, use the textbox to make choices and respond to the different game obstacles.

You will start with three lives. If you lose all your lives, the game will end.

The goal of the game is to make it safely to the end of the journey.
