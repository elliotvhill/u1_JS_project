## Getting Started

You will receive prompts at the top of the screen. At the bottom of the screen, use the textbox to make choices and respond to the different game obstacles.

At the start of the game you will choose to play as one of three characters. Each character has advantages and disadvantages that will impact the game. Choose wisely!!

You will start with three lives. The game ends if you lose all your lives.

The goal of the game is simply to make it safely to the end of the journey!

### How to play

Use the keyboard to make choices based on the game prompts. For example, 'Y' or 'N' for a yes/no question, number keys to choose from a list of options, etc.

Pretty straightforward stuff!
